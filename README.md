# nQuack

nQuack is a modified statistical framework to predict ploidy level based on sequence data. We build upon [Weib et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-018-2128-z) Gaussian Mixture Model approach to estimate ploidy level, which was originally written as [a C executable](https://github.com/clwgg/nQuire).
